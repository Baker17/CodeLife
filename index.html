        <p>I'm Tonisha Baker and I am a professional Women's Baskebtball Player in Marburg, Germany and also a
            self-taught
            full-stack
            python/django web developer. I am Looking foward to making a transition as a full-time developer as I am
            building a
            career as far as life after basketball.</p>
        <br>

        <p>During this Journey of maximizing my own potential I will eventually document every step of the way in hopes
            to inspire
            and
            motivate others to be the best that they can be and maximizing their potential as they make transitions into
            the
            beautiful world of full-stack development also.</p>
        <br>

        <p>Athough my strengths are with using python and django I have experience with javascript, html and css.
            I am improving my skills everyday and have a desire to be a part of helping a company build and improve with
            efficiency.
            If you are captivated by what you see and feel as though I can be an asset to your company don't hesitate to
            reach out and send an E-mail.
